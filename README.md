## Goals and Philosophies

- no useless abstractions
- small API footprint = little learning curve
- relatively "low-level" to remove restraints
- composable styles by default, root component overrides
- components are modular/atomic
- unbranded but still aesthetically pleasing
- out-of-the-box dark mode
- themeable with any colors

---

This ðŸ‘‡ is what's currently planned. This is mostly a scratch pad of ideas and will probably change.

## Colors

- brand â€”Â main brand color
- accent â€” branded accent color, primarily used for controls
- danger â€” for errors, danger text is fine but use it seldomly
- warning â€” for warnings, use this for icon colors but not text
- info â€”Â semantic info color, use this like warning. don't make "info" buttons
- bland â€” semantic default color, use this for plain controls and dividers. this is

- surface (dynamic)
- contrast (dynamic)

- current (dynamic)
