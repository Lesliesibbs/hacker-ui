# Typography

Typography in Hacker UI is simple. There are a small set of pre-defined typography classes that you can pick from.

This set is purposefully small so it's easier to make the right decision on which typography class you should pick.

**An important thing to note:** The names of the typography classes (e.g. `styles.fonts.h1`, `styles.fonts.h2`, etc) does _not_ mean they have to be used in an `<h1/>` tag. These styles are just styles. The semantics should live in the HTML.

## All Typography Example

There is no typography component in Hacker UI. Instead, there are pre-defined typography classes that you can apply to any element.

<AllTypographyExample />

## Typography Pairings

<TypographyPairingsExample />
